# DeepThought42
Public project to build sound logic programs and thought processes. Everyone is welcome to contribute, call it dumb, prove it wrong, etc! Have fun, and remember, the answer was always 42.

A great place to hear some more ideas about the circular logic proposed in this project can be found by simply searching for others that were deeply interested in the subject. Check out Kurt Gödel, Blaise Pascal, René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz...and I'm sure many others. I didn't realize we were all working on a similar project. I get it now, but do not understand their math. I believe this is why this project is necessary. X must always equal X. Added by Jarrod 29 Aug 2024 1143 CDT
