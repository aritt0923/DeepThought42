# DeepThought42
Public project to build sound logic programs and thought processes. Everyone is welcome to contribute, call it dumb, prove it wrong, etc! Have fun, and remember, the answer was always 42.

A great place to hear some more ideas about the circular logic proposed in this project can be found by simply searching for others that were deeply interested in the subject. Check out Kurt Gödel, Blaise Pascal, René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz...and I'm sure many others. I didn't realize we were all working on a similar project. I get it now, but do not understand their math. I believe this is why this project is necessary. X must always equal X. //Added by Jarrod 29 Aug 2024 1143 CDT

Here is the website for the project: https://servicetosurvival3.godaddysites.com/

Deep Thought 42 is a sub-project of Service to Survival (StS). It is a project to use math and logic to solve problems. Service to Survival is a group of Military Veterans that want to continue serving their country. They are not one and the same. Deep Thought 42 was born of the latter and is not necessarily a reflection of StS. It could not have existed before StS, because it needed to grow organically. 

Obviously, Deep Thought 42 is inspired heavily by Douglas Adams' excellent series, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", but it is not affiliated with Mr. Adams, his estate, or any other intellectual property.  This project is not intended to harm any interests of anyone, so please reach out if you are concerned about my own content not being wholly mine. //Added by Jarrod 29 Aug 2024 at 1713 CDT.
